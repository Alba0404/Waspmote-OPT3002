# Waspmote-OPT3002
A simple Waspmote library for the Texas Instruments OPT3002 Light-to-Digital Sensor.

This library was a one shot test. I had to use a Waspmote board with an OPT3002 sensor for a school project
so I code this library. Since I do not have now these board and sensor I won't maintain this library.
